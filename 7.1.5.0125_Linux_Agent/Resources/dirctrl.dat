// Linux Directory Control File differs from windows a bit.
// Unix-style comments (#) are valid along with (//).
// The file is split into four sections of identical format.
//
// Directory names can be separated with a ';' or a newline.
// Two modes of name expansion are supported: "like" search and regexp.
// "like" supports wildcard characters '%' at beginning and/or end
// of a pattern (e.g. %bin, bin%, %bin%) - it is similar to "like"
// operator in rules. If '%' are not specified at beginning and/or end
// of a pattern, it is treated as a regexp pattern.

# List of directories to be scanned.
# IMPORTANT! Only directories specified in this section are scanned -
# this list takes precedence over "scanFixed[Removable]Drives" settings!
# If nothing is specified in this section, scanning starts from /.
# Name expansion is NOT supported in this section,
# only exact directory names should be used!
SECTION INCLUDE:

#/home;/media;/mnt

# Directories excluded from scan (and thus from classification and encryption)
# Name expansion is supported.
